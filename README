We analyse a global dataset documenting effects of diversified farming practices on biodiversity and agronomic yields compiled through a systematic review of primary studies. The dataset includes 4076 comparisons of biodiversity outcomes from 237 articles, and 1222 comparisons of yield outcomes from 57 articles. It contains evidence from 48 countries of effects on species from 33 taxonomic orders (spanning insects, plants, birds, mammals, eukaryotes, annelids, fungi, and bacteria) of diversifying farms producing annual or perennial crops across 12 FAO commodity groups. Data collection and reporting followed best standards for systematic reviews and was specifically designed for use in meta-analysis. The dataset was used to analyse synergies and trade-offs for biodiversity and yield when farmland is diversified, by applying multinomial and quantum regression models.

The R scripts are meant for use in sequential order to: 
4-1 calculate effect sizes, post-classify qualitative data, format data for analysis
4-2 fit multinomial logit models
4-3 fit quantum regression models
